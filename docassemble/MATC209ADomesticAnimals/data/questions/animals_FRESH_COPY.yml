  • Give the animals to you to keep them safe</p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0 0 10px 0; color: #14558F; font-weight: 600;">Important:</p>
  <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0; color: #333; font-size: 15px;">You must already have an open court case to use this form. This cannot be filed on its own.</p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0 0 10px 0; color: #14558F; font-weight: 600;">What you need:</p>
  <p style="margin: 0; color: #333; font-size: 15px;">• Docket number of your existing case<br>
  • Names of the animals<br>
